## Code Survival
This analysis shows, how much originally authored code by a group member
has actually survived it to the status quo.

### Sensible Preprocessors
- **Remove Outlier Blame** &  **Remove Outlier Commits**: If your students accidentially commit big files,
such as images or videos, you can remove those with this preprocessor.

- **Unify Authors For Commits** &  **Unify Authors For Blame**: If some
authors have used multiple aliases, you should de-alias them before analysis.

### Aspects worth investigating
- very low code survival of single members compared to the rest of the team
- generally low code survival for all team members
