## Activity Over Time
This analysis allows to gain deeper insights into 
when students have been active during the project and how intensely.

### Suitable Preprocessors
- **Unify Authors For Commits**: If your students commit with multiple accounts, 
you should add such a preprocessor to de-alias your authors.

### Aspects worth investigating
- longer phases of inactivity (days, weeks) may indicate procrastinative behavior 
- strong deviations in activity near dates of major deadlines
