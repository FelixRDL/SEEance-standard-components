## Files by number of coauthors
Check, how many authors have commited on certain files.

### Sensible Preprocessors
- **Unify Authors For Commits**: If some authors have used multiple 
aliases, you should de-alias them before analysis.

### Aspects worth investigating
- determine code hotspots/god classes (where all authors need to contribute)
- determine degree of member specialization/generalization in development
