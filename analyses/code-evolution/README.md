## Code Evolution
This analysis shows source code growth over time.

### Suitable Preprocessors
- **Remove Outlier Commits**: If your students accidentially commit big files,
such as images or videos, you can remove those with this preprocessor.

### Aspects worth investigating
- beginning date of the development
- slope of LOC growth
- project growth around major deadlines
- outliers (e.g. pushing of library files)
